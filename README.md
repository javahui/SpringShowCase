<h1>Spring-Show-Case</h1>

I want to demonstrate capabilities of <b>Spring Framework</b> - mainly <b>Spring MVC</b>. It is of course only my [pure] version of <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-mvc-showcase" style="color:red">Spring-show-case</a>.
I have created it, in order to equip myself with small, ready-to-implement modules, but I will be delighted if it help you 
also :)

<h3>You find here:</h3>
 - example of form processing[now with .jsp as view provider]
 - of course, simple spring configuration 
 - jpa/hibernate support
 - simple example of servlet filters
 - you will see how to return json as request result [we will handle it with javascript]
	in other words, we provide RESTful Web Service
