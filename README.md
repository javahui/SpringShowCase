<h1>Spring-Show-Case</h1>

I want to demonstrate capabilities of <b>Spring Framework</b> - mainly <b>Spring MVC</b>. It is of course only my [pure] version of 
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-mvc-showcase.
I have created it, in order to equip myself with small, ready-to-implement modules, but I will be delighted if it help you 
also :)

<h3>You find here:</h3>
 - example of form processing[now with .jsp as view provider]
 - of course, simple spring configuration
