I want to demonstrate capabilities of Spring Framework - mainly Spring MVC. It is of course only my [pure] version of 
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-mvc-showcase in order to equip You with small, ready-to-implement modules.

 - example of form processing[now with .jsp as view provider]
 - of course, simple spring configuration
